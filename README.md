# redhat-raffle-sap-hana

This project is a sample application using OpenShift, SAP HANA, Hibernate and Spring Boot to illustrate AppDev with Red Hat and SAP. It uses a raffle as an example, but can be repurposed as a starter application for any enterprise development project that requires integrating SAP data in containers.
